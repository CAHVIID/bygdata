The Department of Civil Engineering (BYG) at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has through different projects initiated a data platform to support researchers and students to work with data and databases. The overall objective with the data platform is to make the learning curve less steep and facilitate data-driven research and results.

The content of the Github account is different code snippets for DTU BYGs data platform, mostly sensor integration examples.
